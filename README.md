Fushigi da ne ima no kimochi
Sora kara futte kita mitai
Tokubetsuna kisetsu no iro ga
tokimeki o miseru yo

Hajimete deatta toki kara
Yokan ni sawagu kokoro no Melody
Tomerarenai tomaranai naze?

Todokete!
Setsunasa ni wa namae o tsukeyou ka

## Snow Halation

Welcome to my mod, Snow Halation, or Halation for short! :snowflake:

It is a mod pack for Slay The Spire featuring as many relics, combats and events that I can think of. 

The current build of Halation is **not ready for public release.** If you wish to build it yourself then go ahead but there are no guarantees it works without crashing every couple seconds.

Halation is a love letter of mine, to the anime and game series that I love and have shaped me as a person, and, of course, to Slay the Spire itself. If you do not want to play Slay The Spire and have anime or anything like that shoved in your face, worry not. Everything is just merely a reference, and you can play hundreds of runs and not notice that the relics and events are anime inspired.

Keep in mind this is a passion project of mine to the things I love, so I won't be taking suggestions unless I ask for them directly.
